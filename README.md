# IVAN
A virtual assistant based on Python and Natural Language Processing (NLTK)

This project is a Smart AI-based virtual assistant which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand human language and give response or solutions in a particular field of Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES).
In IT enabled services, IT support requires more time and the user has to wait for a while to get a proper solution from the IT support team. This process is made more easy and faster by our virtual assistant.
